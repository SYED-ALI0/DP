Problem Statement:
A library management system has been implemented in Java, consisting of multiple classes to represent books, 
library users, the library itself, and a controller for managing book checkouts and check-ins.
The system is designed to allow users to check out and return books from the library.
However, there are several issues and limitations with the current implementation.

With Grasp:
Information Expert: Each class (Book, Library, LibraryUser, LibraryController) encapsulates its own data and relevant behavior, adhering to the Information Expert principle.

Creator: The Library class is responsible for creating and managing books.

Controller: The LibraryController class acts as a controller responsible for managing book checkouts and check-ins.

Pure Fabrication: The LibraryUser class represents a pure fabrication as it doesn't correspond to a real-world entity but is used to demonstrate the concept.

Indirection: The LibraryController class acts as an intermediary between users and the library, providing an indirect way to manage books.

Protected Variation: The Library class hides the details of book management, allowing for changes in the book storage mechanism without affecting clients.

Polymorphism: While not explicitly shown in this example, polymorphism can be applied when handling different types of library items (e.g., books, DVDs) under the same interface.
This can be achieved by creating a common interface for library items and having various classes implement it.

Without Grasp:
This version of the code retains the same functionality as the previous one but simplifies the structure without explicitly adhering to the GRASP principles.
It still models a library system with books, users, and book checkout/check-in operations.
